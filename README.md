# QuantDreamLib

**Aim**  
QuantDreamLib is a small C\+\+ sandbox made to explore quantitative finance ideas while practicing modern C\+\+. It focuses on clear, minimal class structures for market data (time series, data points, parsing) to keep concepts approachable.

**Scope**  
\- Represent basic market data (prices, volume, symbols) with simple types.  
\- Separate concerns: fetching, storing, transforming.  
\- Provide a base that can be extended (indicators, risk tools, simple backtesting).  
\- Highlight practical patterns: interfaces, smart pointers, const\-correctness, modular design.

**Philosophy**  
Keep it minimal. Prefer readability over optimization. Grow features gradually as understanding improves.

**Future Direction (Exploratory)**  
\- Indicator layers (e.g. moving averages)  
\- Lightweight backtest scaffolding  
\- Data cleaning / normalization helpers  
\- Hooks to analysis or scripting tools

**Project Identity**  
A bridge between theory learned in class and real C\+\+ implementation patterns used in quantitative development.
